# Calculator App

A simple yet polished calculator experience built with React Native and Expo. The design mirrors the familiar four-column layout from classic handheld calculators while adding modern styling, subtle shadows, and responsive text sizing.

## Features

- Standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Support for decimal input, percentage conversion, and sign toggling
- Error handling for division by zero with clear messaging
- Responsive layout that adapts to varying device sizes
- Operator indicator to show the pending operation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Use the Expo Go app on your device or an emulator to preview the calculator UI.

## Project Structure

- `App.js` – Main React Native entry point containing the calculator UI and logic.
- `app.json` – Expo configuration file describing the project metadata.
- `package.json` – Project manifest with dependencies and scripts.

## Testing

Manual testing is recommended to verify input flows and operator combinations.
